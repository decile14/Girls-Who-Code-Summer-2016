  <h1>Good Police Must Speak Out Against Bad Officers</h1>
  <h3>By Shaun King for the New York Daily News on Friday, August 12, 2016, 2:23 PM
  <p>My wife loves me. I love her.<br>I'm 36 years old and have been with her since I was 16. We've lived all over the world together. We went to college together. We've bought and lost homes. We've made and lost friends. We've birthed three kids and raised many more. We've had injuries, surgeries and recoveries. We've had successes and failures.</p>
  <p>We were kids when we fell for each other, but now we're starting to grow our first gray hairs. She's my best friend, lover and confidante.</p>
  <p>We are absolutely ride or die for one another, but I know that even "ride or die" has limits.</p>
  <p>As much as my wife loves me and has supported me through the highs and lows of life, I know if I have an affair with another woman, particularly in light of how loyal my wife has been through all the drama that being married to me brings, that all that good will goes out the window. She'd be right.</p>
  <p>If I harmed the kids somehow, which I, of course never would, all that "ride or die" talk is over.</p>
  <p>If I humiliated her and the family with some outrageous Anthony Weiner-style foolishness, my wife is not playing the role of Huma Abedin. That's just not who she is.</p>
  <p>Now, I choose fidelity and integrity for my family because those are values that have deep meaning in my life. I want to be a great husband and father for a host of reasons, but I am keenly aware that if I screw it all up, my wife — God bless her soul — is done.</p>
  <p>While I don't need that knowledge to motivate me to be who I am, it definitely exists somewhere in my mind. The worst decisions I could ever make seem so costly that I just don't consider them.</p>
  <p>But this is not a relationship column. I'm here to talk about how we end police brutality in this generation.</p>
  <p>I said all of that about my own life to say that the worst police in America are fully aware that when they screw up on the job — be it with incompetence, racism, corruption, or the worst brutality imaginable — they have a large group of people who will have their back no matter what. That healthy sence of accountability and pressure that I have in marriage just doesn't exist in law enforcement.</p>
  <p>Bad policing of all kinds is repeatedly tolerated from coast to coast. Every Justice Department investigation into police departments in Cleveland, Baltimore, Seattle, Albuquerque, Ferguson and elsewhere has said as much.</p>
  <p>While American police publicly lament the "no snitching" culture prevalent in America's inner cities, they are masters of it. This is not just bad culture, it's downright dangerous. The recent DOJ probe into the Baltimore Police Department was as damning as they come. Police were found to have used force 2,818 times over the past six years — with only one instance being deemed a violation of policy.</p>
  <p>In case after case of brutality, corruption and misconduct, investigators and other officers consistently looked the other way, creatively stalled investigations into bad policing, and even coached fellow officers with the right words to say before they would be recorded.</p>
  <p>One Baltimore police officer, Joseph Crystal, did speak up on corrupt cops. Soon he found a dead rat on his car. Later, when he called for backup in a chase, nobody responded.</p>
  <p>Another African-American sergeant on the Baltimore Police force who reported misconduct had signs put up all around his desk by a lieutenant telling him to "mind his own business." It made him a pariah. Speaking out comes with a heavy price.</p>
  <p>Good cops, as a general rule, don't speak out on bad cops — even in some of the most egregious scenarios. That makes me wonder how "good" the good cops truly are, if they are willing to tolerate brutality and corruption. Even if they don't quite do the worst deeds themselves, when good cops are silent — or even worse, supportive — it only serves to empower and grow the very worst trends in policing.</p>
  <p>Every case of police brutality is unique. Some instances, though, are so flagrant that the deafening silence from the law enforcement community is telling.</p>
  <p>Eric Garner should not have been choked to death. Nothing he did warranted a brutal takedown and forceful choke. He was a nonviolent man who was, at the worst, committing a petty misdemeanor — and that was never even proven. At least 57% of Americans said it was wrong for NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo to avoid indictment. Even former President George W. Bush said the decision was "hard to understand."</p>
  <p>Police were silent, though, on the injustice. Ed Mullins, head of the NYPD Sergeants Benevolent Association, even went so far as to call it "obscene" that the city paid a settlement to Garner's family and said Garner should not have "resisted arrest."</p>
  <p>Often, unfortunately, when we hear from police and police unions, this is what we get.</p>
  <p>When Florida behavioral therapist Charles Kinsey, a black man, was shot by a North Miami police officer as he attempted to calm an autistic patient, no police spoke out on how outrageous the shooting was, how the officer needed to be fired, and how it was a sign of just how terrible policing can be. Instead, the local police union excused it and said the officer, who fired his gun repeatedly for no real reason, actually meant to hit the unarmed autistic patient.</p>
  <p>This is ridiculous.</p>
  <p>Bad policing exists for many reasons. That's why this is a 25-part series and not a three-part series. However, bad police have way too much of peace of mind knowing no matter what they do, or whom they do it to, it's highly likely their colleagues will either be completely silent — or even say they were right to be brutal in the first place.</p>
  <p>Good police, if we are to ever move forward in this country, must speak out on bad police and bad policing.</p>
